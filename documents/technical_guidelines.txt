# TechCorp Technical Guidelines - Development Standards

## Software Development Standards and Best Practices

Version 2.1 | Engineering Department | Last Updated: November 2023

### Code Quality Standards

#### 1. General Principles
- Follow SOLID principles
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming conventions
- Keep functions small and focused (max 50 lines recommended)
- Maintain a maximum cyclomatic complexity of 10

#### 2. Version Control (Git)
- Use feature branches: `feature/TICKET-123-description`
- Bug fix branches: `bugfix/TICKET-456-description`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/TICKET-789-description`
- Commit messages must include ticket number: `[TICKET-123] Add user authentication`
- Squash commits before merging to main

#### 3. Code Review Requirements
- All code must be reviewed by at least one team member
- Critical paths require two reviewers
- Reviews should be completed within 24 hours
- Automated checks must pass before review

### Testing Standards

#### Unit Testing
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new code
- 90% coverage for critical business logic
- Use descriptive test names: `test_user_can_login_with_valid_credentials`
- Mock external dependencies

#### Integration Testing
- Cover all API endpoints
- Test database operations
- Verify third-party integrations
- Run in CI/CD pipeline

#### Performance Testing
- Load test for expected 2x normal traffic
- Response time < 200ms for API calls (p95)
- Memory usage within allocated limits

### API Design Standards

#### RESTful Conventions
- Use plural nouns for resources: `/users`, `/orders`
- Use HTTP methods appropriately:
  - GET for retrieval
  - POST for creation
  - PUT/PATCH for updates
  - DELETE for removal
- Return appropriate status codes
- Include pagination for list endpoints

#### API Documentation
- All endpoints documented in OpenAPI/Swagger
- Include request/response examples
- Document error responses
- Keep documentation in sync with code

### Security Guidelines

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Use OAuth 2.0 / JWT for API authentication
- Implement RBAC for authorization
- Token expiration: 1 hour (access), 7 days (refresh)
- Never store sensitive data in JWT payload

#### Data Protection
- Encrypt PII at rest and in transit
- Use parameterized queries (no SQL injection)
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Log security events for auditing

### Deployment Process

1. **Development** - Feature branch, local testing
2. **Code Review** - PR submission, peer review
3. **Staging** - Automated deployment, QA testing
4. **Production** - Approved by team lead, monitored rollout

### Incident Management

- **P1 (Critical)**: System down, immediate response, 15-min escalation
- **P2 (High)**: Major feature broken, 4-hour resolution target
- **P3 (Medium)**: Minor issues, 24-hour resolution target
- **P4 (Low)**: Cosmetic issues, addressed in normal sprint
